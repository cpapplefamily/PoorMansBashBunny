For very little money (about 1/10th of the real BashBunny) you can make a clone with many of the same powerfull features.

## Changes I made:
- Changed GPIO-PINs
- RGB led instead of two single-color leds
- Support for a RGB-LED (compatible to bash bunnys LED-command)
- Added RUN command from hak5
- Increased size of STORAGE to 256MB
- Set an alias Q=QUACK (for better bunnyscript support)
- Started adding a german keyboard layout

## Cool ideas for the future:
- User zero pi w to open a wifi hotspot and allow some kind of remote control
- Add an i2c display
